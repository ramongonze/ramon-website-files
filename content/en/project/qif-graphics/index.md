Graphical tool for representing the Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) among a set of three secrets. Developed in C/C++ all the graphic structures were made using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to compile the project to WebAssembly.

The tool is available [here](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~ramon.gonze/qif-graphics).
