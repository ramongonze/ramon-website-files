abstract: |2-
  Local differential privacy (LDP) was developed to avoid the necessity of a trusted central curator, but many implementations do so at the cost of accuracy. In response, the shuffle model has emerged as a way to provide greater anonymity to users by randomly permuting the messages such that the connection between users and values is lost. By combining a LDP mechanism with a shuffler, privacy can be improved at no cost for accuracy, thereby improving the trade-off between privacy and utility. However, the privacy implications of the shuffle layer are not always immediate nor are the derivations of the privacy bounds easy to understand. 

  In this paper, we interpret the shuffle model in the framework of quantitative information flow (QIF), thus providing an alternative view of it. We believe that such interpretation will contribute to make the shuffle model more intuitive and lay the basis for exploring its properties and for proving them formally. 

  In QIF, the privacy loss is measured in terms of information leakage. We provide formulas that show how the shuffler improves the protection against leaks in the local model, and study how the leakage decreases in function of the number of participants in the protocol, for various values of the privacy parameter of the LDP mechanism.
